# Step 1: Data Preparation
**Using OpenCV to trim the video into frames in numerical order and time stamps.**
- Prepare the pickleball video
- Change the "video_path" and "output_folder" filepath
- Run "python3 frames_gen.py" in terminal    
The developer (aka. me) trim the video of single player into 300 frames and the video of couple player into 700 frames with the mean density is 5 frames per second (FPS).

# Step 2: Auto label using YOLO
